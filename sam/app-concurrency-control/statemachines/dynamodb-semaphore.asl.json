Containing this in a parallel allows for visual separation when viewing the state machine and makes it easier to reuse this same logic elsewhere if desired. Because this state sets ResultPath: null, it will not manipulate the execution input that is passed on to the subsequent part of your statemachine that is responsible for doing the work.",

This update will do two things: 1) increment a counter for the number of held locks and 2) add an attribute to the DynamoDB Item with a unique key for this execution and with a value of the time when the lock was Acquired. The Update includes a conditional expression that will fail under two circumstances: 1) if the maximum number of locks have already been distributed or 2) if the current execution already owns a lock. The latter check is important to ensure the same execution doesn't increase the counter more than once. If either of these conditions are not met, then the task will fail with a DynamoDB.ConditionalCheckFailedException error, retry a few times, then if it is still not successful, it will move off to another branch of the workflow. If this is the first time that a given lockname has been used, there will not be a row in DynamoDB, so the update will fail with DynamoDB.AmazonDynamoDBException. In that case, this state sends the workflow to state that will create that row to initialize.",
